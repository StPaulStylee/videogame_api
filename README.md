##Created By: Jeffrey Miller

###What is videogame_api?
The web application - which is actually titled BrokenClock! - is a CRUD application that uses a video game API developed by a website
named Giant Bomb. With this API, users can search any video game title and receive up to a 30 results on the title they entered. From their,
they can add that title to their favorites or add them to their wishlist.

###How was it built?
The application uses SANE Stack - SQL(PostgreSQL), Express, Angular, and Node. Also, Various Angular dependencies were used including -
angular-route, angular-animate, angular-sanitze, ui-select, and ui-bootstrap.

### What's next?
Currently, there is no user authentication built into the application. In the near future, I will use Passport.js to create a registration 
and login feature, which will allow for users to have a much more personal experience. Also, I will expand upon the searches capabilities
by allowing users to search in different categories, which will undoubtabley, give them wider results.

### Is BrokenClock! live on the web?
Check by tomorrow where I will have it deployed onto Heroku!
